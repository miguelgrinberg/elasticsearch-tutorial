This section goes over what you need before you begin to work on this tutorial.

- **A computer**

   This is a hands-on tutorial, so you will need to use a computer on which you can work. Using the tutorial as a guide, you will create a small search project.

   You can use any relatively modern laptop or desktop computer, be it Windows, Mac, or Linux. If you use a Windows computer, you will have a much better experience following this tutorial if you use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which gives you a native Linux environment.


- **Basic familiarity with the command-line prompt in your operating system**

   This tutorial requires you to work in the command-line, so you are expected to have some experience working with `bash` or a similar shell. If you are using Windows, working under WSL would give you exactly the same experience a Linux or Mac user would have. If you, however, prefer to use PowerShell, then you will need to translate some `bash` commands to their Windows equivalents.
